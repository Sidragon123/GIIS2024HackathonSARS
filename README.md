# Branches
Make **your own branch for each part of the project**. Commit changes to **this branch only**. Do **not** merge your branch with main until someone reviews your code.

# Changes to main
Switch to the `main` branch on VSCode with `git checkout main` or by selecting the main branch in the bottom left. Use `git pull` to update changes in your local setup. Switch back to the branch you are working on. Use `git rebase main` in the terminal to update your branch with the new main.

# Commiting Changes
Go to the tree icon on the left sidebar on VSCode called '_Source Control_'. Add a commit message in the input about the '_Sync Changes_' button,, then hit _Sync Changes_. Then press the button again to commit changes to your branch.
