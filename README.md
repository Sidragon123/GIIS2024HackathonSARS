# Branches
Make **your own branch for each part of the project**. Commit changes to **this branch only**. Open a pull request once all commits are done to merge with `main`.

# Changes to main
Switch to the `main` branch on VSCode with `git checkout main` or by selecting the main branch in the bottom left. Use `git pull` to update changes in your local setup. Switch back to the branch you are working on. Use `git rebase main` in the terminal to update your branch with the new main.

# Commiting Changes
Go to the tree icon on the left sidebar on VSCode called '_Source Control_'. Add a commit message in the input about the '_Sync Changes_' button,, then hit _Sync Changes_. Then press the button again to commit changes to your branch. Finally, if the work you're doing on your branch is complete, go to GitHub, into your branch, and click _Open Pull Request_ to queue its merging to the main branch.
